# ML_from_scratch
This repository contains notebooks with implementations of machine learning basic techniques such as cross-validation, kNN, linear regression, logistic regression, naive bayes, and random forest. They were developed during a class of machine learning within my master's degree. Credits to the authors of the labs.
